Today working more on DEM and cyberGIS.

- Building a raster index, following [this](http://www.gdal.org/gdaltindex.html)
- Eventually uploading all DEMs to Roger

todo$add("upload all DEMs to Roger")
todo$add("build DEM index shapefile")

Some further notes on sshfs following troubleshooting

- use `-o reconnect,idmap=user,password_stdin,dev,suid` (from [here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41029))
- use `-o ServerAliveInterval 15` (from [here](https://blog.nelhage.com/2008/03/automounting-sshfs/))

So my mounting command is `sudo sshfs $ROGER: /mnt/roger -o reconnect -o ServerAliveInterval 15 -o allow_other`
