Today Roger is down. Other stuff to work on:

- project writeup
    - make figures
    - make tables
- sharing Roger results
- tidying local directory

Cleanup to do on ROGER, once I have access again:

- merge rogerRuns directories
- remove ranchoViejo/flowCondition/streamnet subdirectory


Figures for writeup

- GIS
    - indices of DEMs
    - study area overview
- schematic
    - workflow
    
    
Roger is back up early!
